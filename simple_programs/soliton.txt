1 . What is an automorphic number?
 
    A number is called an automorphic number if and only if the square of the given number ends with the same number itself. 
    For example, 25, 76 are automorphic numbers because their square is 625 and 5776, 
    respectively and the last two digits of the square represent the number itself. 
    Some other automorphic numbers are 5, 6, 36, 890625, etc.

2 .   Harshad number 

    A number is said to be the Harshad number if it is divisible by the sum of its digit.
    For example, if number is 156, then sum of its digit will be 1 + 5 + 6 = 12. Since 156 is divisible by 12. 
    So, 156 is a Harshad number.
    Some of the other examples of Harshad number are 8, 54, 120, etc.
    To find whether the given number is a Harshad number or not, 
    calculate the sum of the digit of the number then, check whether the given number is divisible by the sum of its digit. If yes, then given number is a Harshad number.
