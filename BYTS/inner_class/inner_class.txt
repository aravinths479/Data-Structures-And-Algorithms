an inner class is a class that is defined within another class. 

Inner classes have access to the members (including private members) of the outer class, 
and they can be used to logically group and encapsulate code.

There are several types of inner classes in Java:

Member Inner Class:

Defined at the member level of a class.
Can access the members of the outer class, including private members.
Static Nested Class:

Similar to a member inner class, but it is declared static.
Cannot access non-static members of the outer class directly.
Local Inner Class:

Defined within a method or a block of code.
Has access to the variables and parameters of the enclosing method.
Anonymous Inner Class:

A class without a name, defined and instantiated at the same time.
Often used for event handling and implementing interfaces.
Use Cases of Inner Classes:

Encapsulation: Inner classes help in encapsulating the code within a class, providing a clear and logical structure.
Code Organization: They are useful for grouping related classes together, improving code organization.
Access to Outer Class Members: Inner classes can access private members of the outer class, facilitating data hiding.
