A queue and a priority queue are both abstract data types used in computer science to organize 
and manage collections of elements. 
However, they differ in how they handle the order in which elements are processed.

1. **Queue:**
   - A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
   - Elements are added to the back (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue) of the queue.
   - It operates on the basis that the first element added is the first one to be processed.
   - Common operations include enqueue (add an element to the end of the queue) and dequeue 
     (remove the element from the front of the queue).

2. **Priority Queue:**
   - A priority queue is a data structure that assigns priorities to elements and processes them based on these priorities.
   - Elements with higher priorities are processed before elements with lower priorities.
   - It does not strictly follow the FIFO principle; elements are processed based on their priority.
   - Common operations include inserting an element with a priority, and extracting the element with the highest priority.

**Key Differences:**
- **Ordering:** Queue follows the FIFO order, while priority queue processes elements based on their priority.
  
- **Processing Order:** In a queue, elements are processed in the order they are added. In a priority queue, 
                        elements are processed based on their assigned priorities.

- **Usage:** Queues are commonly used in scenarios where the order of arrival is significant, 
             like in task scheduling or print job queues. 
             Priority queues are used when elements need to be processed in a specific order based on their priority, 
             such as in Dijkstra's algorithm or Huffman coding.

- **Implementation:** Queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. Priority queues can be implemented using 
                    various data structures, such as binary heaps, Fibonacci heaps, or self-balancing binary search trees.
